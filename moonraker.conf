[power BLV]
type: mqtt
#qos:
#  The MQTT QOS level to use when publishing and subscribing to topics.
#  The default is to use the setting supplied in the [mqtt] section.
command_topic: shellies/BLV/relay/0/command
#  The mqtt topic used to publish commands to the device.  This parameter must
#  be provided.
command_payload: {command}
#  The payload sent with the topic.  This can be a template, with a "command"
#  variable included in the template context, where "command" is either "on"
#  or "off".  For example:
#    {% if command == "on" %}
#      TURN_ON
#    {% else %}
#      TURN_OFF
#    {% endif %}
#  The above example would resolve to "TURN_ON" if the request is turn the
#  the device on, and "TURN_OFF" if the request is to turn the device off.
#  This parameter must be provided.
retain_command_state: False
#  If set to True the retain flag will be set when the command topic is
#  published.  Default is False.
state_topic: shellies/BLV/relay/0
#  The mqtt topic to subscribe to for state updates.  This parameter must be
#  provided.
#state_response_template: 
#  A template used to parse the payload received with the state topic.  A
#  "payload" variable is provided the template's context.  This template
#  must resolve to "on" or "off".  For example:
#    {% set resp = payload|fromjson %}
#    {resp["POWER"]}
#  The above example assumes a json response is received, with a "POWER" field
#  that set to either "ON" or "OFF".  The resolved response will always be
#  trimmed of whitespace and converted to lowercase. The default is the payload.
state_timeout: 2
#  The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the state topic to receive an
#  update. If the timeout expires the device revert to an "error" state.  This
#  timeout is applied during initialization and after a command has been sent.
#  The default is 2 seconds.
#query_topic:
#  The topic used to query command state.  It is expected that the device will
#  respond by publishing to the "state_topic".  This parameter is optional,
#query_payload:
#  The payload to send with the query topic.  This may be a template or a string.
#  The default is no payload.
#query_after_command:
#  If set to True Moonraker will publish the query topic after publishing the
#  command topic.  This should only be necessary if the device does not publish a
#  reponse to a command request to the state topic.  The default is False.
off_when_shutdown: True
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
locked_while_printing: True
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
#   If set to True, Moonraker will issue a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to Klipper
#   after the device has been powered on.  The default is False, thus no
#   attempt to made to restart Klipper after power on.
restart_delay: 2
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
