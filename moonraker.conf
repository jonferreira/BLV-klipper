[file_manager]
queue_gcode_uploads: True
enable_object_processing: True
#   When set to True the file manager will add uploads to the job_queue when
#   the `start_print` flag has been set.  The default if False.

[job_queue]
load_on_startup: True
#   When set to true the job queue will attempt to load the next
#   pending job when Klipper reports as "Ready".  If the queue has
#   been paused it will automatically resume.  Note that neither
#   the job_transition_delay nor the job_transition_gcode are
#   applied in this case.  The default is False.
automatic_transition: False
#   When set to True the queue will automatically transition to
#   the next job in the queue after the current job is complete.
#   This is useful for belt printers and other machines with the
#   ability to automate clearing of the build area.  When False
#   the queue will be paused after each job is loaded, requiring
#   that users manually resume to load the next print.  The default
#   is False.
#job_transition_delay:
#   The amount of time to delay after completion of a job before
#   loading the next job on the queue.  The default is no delay.
#job_transition_gcode:
#   A gcode to execute after the completion of a job before the next
#   job is loaded.  If a "job_transition_delay" has been configured
#   this gcode will run after the delay.  The default is no gcode.

[power BLV]
type: mqtt
#qos:
#  The MQTT QOS level to use when publishing and subscribing to topics.
#  The default is to use the setting supplied in the [mqtt] section.
command_topic: shellies/BLV/relay/0/command
#  The mqtt topic used to publish commands to the device.  This parameter must
#  be provided.
command_payload: {command}
#  The payload sent with the topic.  This can be a template, with a "command"
#  variable included in the template context, where "command" is either "on"
#  or "off".  For example:
#    {% if command == "on" %}
#      TURN_ON
#    {% else %}
#      TURN_OFF
#    {% endif %}
#  The above example would resolve to "TURN_ON" if the request is turn the
#  the device on, and "TURN_OFF" if the request is to turn the device off.
#  This parameter must be provided.
retain_command_state: False
#  If set to True the retain flag will be set when the command topic is
#  published.  Default is False.
state_topic: shellies/BLV/relay/0
#  The mqtt topic to subscribe to for state updates.  This parameter must be
#  provided.
#state_response_template: 
#  A template used to parse the payload received with the state topic.  A
#  "payload" variable is provided the template's context.  This template
#  must resolve to "on" or "off".  For example:
#    {% set resp = payload|fromjson %}
#    {resp["POWER"]}
#  The above example assumes a json response is received, with a "POWER" field
#  that set to either "ON" or "OFF".  The resolved response will always be
#  trimmed of whitespace and converted to lowercase. The default is the payload.
state_timeout: 2
#  The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the state topic to receive an
#  update. If the timeout expires the device revert to an "error" state.  This
#  timeout is applied during initialization and after a command has been sent.
#  The default is 2 seconds.
#query_topic:
#  The topic used to query command state.  It is expected that the device will
#  respond by publishing to the "state_topic".  This parameter is optional,
#query_payload:
#  The payload to send with the query topic.  This may be a template or a string.
#  The default is no payload.
#query_after_command:
#  If set to True Moonraker will publish the query topic after publishing the
#  command topic.  This should only be necessary if the device does not publish a
#  reponse to a command request to the state topic.  The default is False.
off_when_shutdown: True
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
locked_while_printing: True
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
#   If set to True, Moonraker will issue a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to Klipper
#   after the device has been powered on.  The default is False, thus no
#   attempt to made to restart Klipper after power on.
restart_delay: 2
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
on_when_job_queued: False
#   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
#   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
#   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
#   below for details. The default is False.
