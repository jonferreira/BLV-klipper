z_hop: 10.0
z_hop_speed: 5.0

[bed_mesh]
speed: 100
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center x,y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0,0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
mesh_min: 8,13
#   Defines the minimum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 308, 338
#   Defines the maximum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.

[probe]
pin: P1.27
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
#deactivate_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should execute deactivation gcode
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. The default is True.
x_offset: -42.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: -2
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.

#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 40
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.

#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
#samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

[z_tilt]
z_positions: 
	350, 170
	0,170
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the XY position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.

	340, 170
	50,170
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
speed: 100
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 4
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.06
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.

[screws_tilt_adjust]

screw1: 72,32
#   The X,Y coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a

#   This is the base screw used in calculations. This parameter must
#   be provided.

#   counter-clockwise decrease.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
